*** January 2019 Update ***
---
Happy New Year, and great news for the Blenduino project: Blenduino has been accepted into a program at ITP called xStory, which is intended to foster development of tools for experimental storytelling. After a brief hiatus for the winter break I'll be continuing work on Blenduino. The first thing on the agenda is to create another roadmap, one that spans 2019. Please feel free to [reach out](https://jameshosken.com/contact/) or open an issue if you have and questions, thoughts, or ideas! 

# Blenduino
Getting things from Arduino to Blender ~and back~


## Overview
Blenduino is an almost-plug-and-play addon for Blender that facilitates easy access to a serial data stream. Bringing information from the physical world into a virtual 3D environment has many potential applications, from experimental new interfaces for 3D modelling and animation to immersive interactive experiences that blend the real and the virtual. Blenduino is not intended to be a robust production system, rather an easy way to get started experimenting!
