# Roadmap


## Create example tutorials
Now that the basic functionality is working, I'd like to get people using Blenduino! I aim to create a simple video walkthrough for getting data from Arduino to Blender, from Blender to Arduino, and then both.

## Add datablock linking in Blenduino UI panel
As of now Blednuino exposes the incomind Serial data to Blender's Scene datablock. I'd like to see if I can expose this to the UI panel of the plugin, perhaps as a driver, so that users don't have to dig deep into Blender's interface to use the incoming data.

## Create physical animated robot
Using 3D printed parts and a few potentiometers, I will demonstrate a potential use case for Blenduino. A complex, nonhumanoid creature can be intuitively and quickly animated by printing out a physical representation and moving joints around in physical space.

## Update plugin for Blender 2.8
Given the imminent release of Blender 2.8, I'd like to spend a bit of time updateing the plugin to work with the new API.
